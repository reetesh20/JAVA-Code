/*
We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract class 'Shape' with three abstract methods
 namely 'RectangleArea' taking two parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are
 its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing 
 all the three methods 'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. 
 Create an object of class 'Area' and call all the three methods.
